So far I have just tried implementing a "Server" class

It just does everything in the constructor
```
Server::Server()
{
	SetupAddrInfo();
	SetupSocket();
	BindSocket();
	Listen();
	Accept();
}
```
(functions are somewhat self-explainatory ;D)

The very basic idea is that it would be able to listen on a port (defined in the header)
and send and receive information with a client

(more details commented in-between the code)

********** commit 20157ce9634ebdda0b24c937971f9acaf7dd9595

Created a client script, it connects to the server and receives a message ("Hello world") from the server
Still didnt fix my mistake to loop through the addrinfo linked list, on it.

********** commit e62299979131c42b1c97dd6d9f629d06ee08578b
Going through a loop for the addrinfo and picking the first socket

Realised that, send() might not send all of the bytes because of circumstances beyond our control
sending partial bytes of information is covered in point 7.1 of the beej's article (in referances)
