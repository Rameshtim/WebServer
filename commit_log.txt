So far I have just tried implementing a "Server" class

It just does everything in the constructor
```
Server::Server()
{
	SetupAddrInfo();
	SetupSocket();
	BindSocket();
	Listen();
	Accept();
}
```
(functions are somewhat self-explainatory ;D)

The very basic idea is that it would be able to listen on a port (defined in the header)
and send and receive information with a client

(more details commented in-between the code)

********** commit 20157ce9634ebdda0b24c937971f9acaf7dd9595

Created a client script, it connects to the server and receives a message ("Hello world") from the server
Still didnt fix my mistake to loop through the addrinfo linked list, on it.

********** commit 8ad5fb4b4c5a2d6661c66a0ee746c62133585c7d
Going through a loop for the addrinfo and picking the first socket
