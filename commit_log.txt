So far I have just tried implementing a "Server" class

It just does everything in the constructor
```
Server::Server()
{
	SetupAddrInfo();
	SetupSocket();
	BindSocket();
	Listen();
	Accept();
}
```
(functions are somewhat self-explainatory ;D)

The very basic idea is that it would be able to listen on a port (defined in the header)
and send and receive information with a client

(more details commented in-between the code)
